##path to store config file for cgroup
/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
##Note:
#In v1.22 and later, if the user does not set the cgroupDriver field under KubeletConfiguration, kubeadm defaults it to systemd.
#In Kubernetes v1.28, you can enable automatic detection of the cgroup driver as an alpha feature
#You just can see confi.yaml file after creating a cluster with kubeadm
##commandline to migrate cgroup driver
kubectl edit cm kubelet-config -n kube-system
