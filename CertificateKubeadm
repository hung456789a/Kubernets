##where configure files is stored /etc/kubernetes
##path to store certificate
/etc/kubernetes/pki
##If a given certificate and private key pair exists before running kubeadm init, 
##kubeadm does not overwrite them. This means you can, for example, copy an existing CA into /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt and /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key, and kubeadm will use this CA for signing the rest of the certificates
